  <p id="tribute info">Conceived as an art school project, Ponytail uses the tools of a rock band to create a unique and desperately jubilant sound that doesn't allow cumbersome things like <i>language</i> kill the special kind of high they're doling out. To hear them is to know what it's like to place your ears inside a grin. The hypnotic riffs of Dustin Wong and Ken Seeno (no bass here, this is a pure sugar-rush), the propulsive drumming of Jeremy Hyman, and the rapturous, delightfully uninhibited vocal stylings of Willy Siegel serve as a sonic reminder that creativity is important and that the space that falls off the page is infinite.</p>
  <p>The short-lived band struck fire three times over their career before disbanding in 2011. Their albums <i>Kamehameha</i>, <i>Ice Cream Spiritual</i>, and <i>Do Whatever You Want All The Time</i> serve as ready reminders of how playful the manipulation of sound can be, and how we might benefit from not taking everything so seriously. </p>
